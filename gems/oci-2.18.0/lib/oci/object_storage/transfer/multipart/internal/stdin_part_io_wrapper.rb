          # A class which wraps standard input ($stdin) so that, for example, piped input can participate
          # in multipart uploads. Standard input is not seekable so we need a special class to handle it
          # rather than using {OCI::ObjectStorage::Transfer::Multipart::Internal::SeekableNonFilePartIOWrapper}.
          #
          # This class can also vend data for each part to upload as part of a multipart upload. However, since
          # we may not know the full size of $stdin beforehand, in addition to vending data this wrapper will
          # also vend the part number to assign to the uploaded part.
          #
          # Reading data out of stdin is synchronised so that only a single thread can read at any one time. This
          # prevents issues where we could write the same part multiple times or write inconsistent data.
