# == SSL Use Case 3 - server *does* authenticate client, client does *not* authenticate server
#
# Subcase 3.A - Message broker configuration does *not* require client authentication
#
# - Expect connection success
# - Expect a verify result of 20 becuase the client did not authenticate the
#   server's certificate.
#
# Subcase 3.B - Message broker configuration *does* require client authentication
#
# - Expect connection success if the server can authenticate the client certificate
# - Expect a verify result of 20 because the client did not authenticate the
#   server's certificate.
